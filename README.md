### Producer Consumer Problem
##### Description:
##### Solution:
### Dining Philosophers' Problem
##### Description:
##### Solution:
### Readers Writers Problem
##### Description:
The Reader-Writer Problem is a classic scenario in Computer Science where multiple processes concurrently access shared resources.The critical section can be accessed by only one writer or by multiple readers simultaneously at any point of time. Semaphores are used to prevent conflicts and ensure proper process synchronization.
##### Solution:
Here, we have presented a Starve-free Solution with pthread implementation using custom semaphores. We used 3 semaphores to make the problem starve free, used pthreads to make the processes parallel and managed the whole synchronization processes using our custom semaphores. The implementation is done keeping in mind that multiple Readers can access the Critical Section together but when a writer is accessing the Critical Section no other Reader or Writer should access it.
